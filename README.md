Golang container images
====================

This repository contains the source for building of
the Go application as a reproducible s2i container image.
Users can choose between RHEL, Fedora and CentOS based builder images.
The resulting image can be run using [podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod), [Docker](http://docker.io) or using [source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/).
Also the whole pipeline from build to app deployment could be run on top of the [Openshift Origin](https://www.okd.io/) or [Red Hat's Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/).

[the Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/sclorg/welcome/blob/master/contribution.md).
